1. Explain inband vs outband sqli ?

    ```text
    SQL Injection is a common web application vulnerability that occurs when an attacker can manipulate the input to an application's database query. By injecting malicious SQL code into the application's input fields, an attacker can manipulate the behavior of the application and potentially gain unauthorized access to its database.

    Now, let's understand the difference between in-band and out-of-band SQL Injection:

    *   In-band SQL Injection (Classic SQLi):
            In-band SQL Injection, also known as Classic SQLi, is the most common type of SQL Injection. It occurs when an attacker is able to retrieve the results of an injected query directly within the response of the application. In other words, the attacker can see the output of their SQL injection attack immediately.

        For example, if an application's search functionality is vulnerable to SQLi, an attacker could inject malicious SQL code that alters the query to retrieve sensitive information from the database. If the application displays the results of the injected query directly in the response, the attacker can observe the extracted data within the same communication channel (i.e., in-band).

    *   Out-of-band SQL Injection:
            Out-of-band SQL Injection occurs when an attacker is not able to retrieve the results of an injected query directly within the application's response. Instead, the attacker uses a separate channel to extract or manipulate the data from the database.

            Out-of-band techniques are typically employed when the application's response does not provide immediate feedback on the success or failure of the injected SQL code. The attacker may use alternative channels such as DNS requests, HTTP requests, or even email notifications to transfer data from the database.
        
        For instance, if an application is vulnerable to out-of-band SQLi, an attacker might inject malicious SQL code that triggers an HTTP request to a server under their control. By monitoring the incoming requests on their server, the attacker can indirectly gather the results of the injected query.

    To summarize, in-band SQL Injection allows an attacker to retrieve the results of an injected query directly within the application's response, while out-of-band SQL Injection relies on alternative channels or mechanisms to gather or manipulate data from the database.

    ```text
    *   DNS Out-of-Band SQL Injection:
            In this technique, the attacker injects malicious SQL code that triggers DNS queries to a DNS server they control. The attacker can then monitor the DNS server logs to extract the desired information from the database. For example, the injected SQL code might manipulate the query to extract sensitive data and encode it in DNS requests.

    *   HTTP Out-of-Band SQL Injection:
            In this technique, the attacker injects SQL code that triggers HTTP requests to a server they control. The injected SQL code can be designed to include the desired data as part of the request parameters or headers. The attacker can analyze the incoming requests on their server to extract the data obtained from the database.

    *   Email Out-of-Band SQL Injection:
            This technique involves injecting SQL code that triggers email notifications to an email account under the attacker's control. The injected code can include the desired data in the email content or subject. By monitoring the incoming emails, the attacker can obtain the extracted information.

    *   File Out-of-Band SQL Injection:
            In this technique, the attacker injects SQL code that triggers the creation or modification of files on the server. The injected code can encode the desired data into the file content or file names. The attacker can then access these files on the server to retrieve the extracted data.

    *   Out-of-Band Time-Based SQL Injection:
            Time-based SQL Injection is a type of out-of-band SQL Injection where the attacker manipulates the SQL query to introduce delays. The attacker can then monitor the response time of the application to determine if the injected query was successful. By controlling the timing of the delay, the attacker can indirectly gather information from the database.

    ```text
    *   Exploiting DNS Out-of-Band SQL Injection:
            In 2016, a vulnerability in the Joomla Content Management System (CMS) allowed attackers to perform SQL Injection attacks. By injecting malicious SQL code, attackers triggered DNS requests to their controlled domain, extracting sensitive data from the compromised database.

    *   Leveraging HTTP Out-of-Band SQL Injection:
            In 2019, a popular hotel booking platform was found to have an SQL Injection vulnerability. Attackers were able to inject SQL code that triggered HTTP requests to their server. The injected code included the extracted data as part of the request headers, enabling the attackers to gather sensitive information from the database.

    *   Demonstrating Email Out-of-Band SQL Injection:
            In 2017, a vulnerability was discovered in a popular e-commerce platform that allowed SQL Injection attacks. Attackers exploited this vulnerability by injecting SQL code that triggered email notifications to their email account. By monitoring the incoming emails, they were able to extract confidential customer data from the database.

    *   Exploiting File Out-of-Band SQL Injection:
            In 2020, a web application vulnerability allowed attackers to execute SQL Injection attacks. By injecting SQL code that manipulated file creation and content, the attackers encoded extracted data into file names and content. They then accessed these files on the server to retrieve the compromised data.

    *   Leveraging Out-of-Band Time-Based SQL Injection:
            In 2018, a vulnerability in a widely used online forum software was discovered. Attackers exploited an SQL Injection flaw and used time-based techniques to infer information from the database indirectly. By introducing delays in the SQL queries, they were able to determine the presence of certain data and gather sensitive information.

2. Explain difference between CSRF and XSRF?

    ```text
    CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) and XSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) are different terms used to describe the same type of web vulnerability. Both refer to an attack where an attacker tricks a victim into unknowingly executing unwanted actions on a web application in which the victim is authenticated.

    Here's a breakdown of CSRF/XSRF and the difference in terminology:

    Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):
    CSRF, also known as "Sea Surf" or "Session Riding," is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to make unauthorized requests on behalf of a victim. The attack occurs when an authenticated user unintentionally triggers a malicious action on a targeted web application, without their knowledge or consent.

    The attacker crafts a malicious website or a URL that contains a request to the targeted web application. When the victim visits the attacker's website or clicks on the malicious URL while still logged into the targeted web application, their browser automatically sends the authenticated request, causing the action to be performed.

    CSRF attacks can lead to unauthorized actions, such as changing the victim's account settings, making fraudulent transactions, or performing actions with potentially serious consequences.

    Cross-Site Request Forgery (XSRF):
    XSRF is essentially the same as CSRF and stands for Cross-Site Request Forgery. The difference in terminology is simply a variation in how the term is commonly referred to. Both terms describe the same type of attack and have the same implications and risks.
  
    The use of "XSRF" as an acronym was originally introduced to avoid confusion with another security term, "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)." However, "CSRF" remains the more widely recognized term, and both are often used interchangeably.
    ```

3. Explain double submit cookie ?

    ```text
    *   The Double Submit Cookie technique is a method used to mitigate Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. It involves the use of a secure cookie to validate the authenticity of requests sent from a web application.

    *   Here's how the Double Submit Cookie technique works:

        Initial Setup:
            When a user logs into a web application, the server generates a unique session ID and associates it with the user's session. Along with the session ID, the server also sets a secure cookie in the user's browser. This secure cookie contains a randomly generated value.

        Synchronization of Cookie and Request Data:
            As the user interacts with the web application, each form submission or critical request includes two components: the actual request data and an additional parameter that includes the value from the secure cookie.

        Verification on the Server:
            When the server receives a request, it checks the value in the secure cookie against the value submitted in the additional parameter. If the values match, it indicates that the request is likely legitimate and not forged.

    *    The key principle behind the Double Submit Cookie technique is that the secure cookie value is not accessible to malicious websites or attackers, thanks to the same-origin policy enforced by web browsers. This makes it difficult for attackers to forge the additional parameter value since they cannot retrieve the secure cookie value.

    *   By including the secure cookie value in each request, the technique provides a form of CSRF protection. Even if an attacker manages to trick a user into submitting a request, they won't have access to the secure cookie value required for successful validation on the server.

    *   It's important to note that implementing the Double Submit Cookie technique requires careful handling of secure cookies, adherence to secure coding practices, and ensuring proper session management to maintain the integrity of the technique.

4. Explain headers related to XSS?

    ```text
    When it comes to mitigating Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks, several HTTP headers play a crucial role in enhancing web application security. These headers help protect against XSS vulnerabilities and enforce stricter browser security policies. Here are some of the important headers related to XSS:

    *   Content-Security-Policy (CSP):
        The Content-Security-Policy header allows web developers to define an approved set of sources from which various resources (such as scripts, stylesheets, images, etc.) can be loaded. It helps mitigate XSS attacks by specifying the allowed origins for content and blocking the execution of scripts from unauthorized sources.

    *   X-XSS-Protection:
        The X-XSS-Protection header instructs the browser to enable its built-in XSS filter, which helps detect and block certain types of reflected XSS attacks. By setting the value to "1" or "1; mode=block," the browser's XSS filter is activated, providing an additional layer of defense against XSS vulnerabilities.

    *   X-Content-Type-Options:
        The X-Content-Type-Options header is used to prevent content type sniffing, which can be exploited in certain XSS attacks. By setting the value to "nosniff," the browser is instructed to strictly honor the declared Content-Type header and not perform content type guessing.

    *   Content-Disposition:
        The Content-Disposition header specifies how the browser should handle the content being served. It can help protect against XSS attacks by specifying the "attachment" disposition, which prompts the browser to download the content rather than displaying it directly. This prevents potentially malicious scripts from executing in the context of the user's session.

    *   Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS):
        Although not directly related to XSS, the Strict-Transport-Security header is essential for overall web security. It enforces secure connections (HTTPS) between the browser and the server, reducing the risk of data interception and injection. By setting the header with the appropriate parameters, HSTS ensures that subsequent requests to the same domain are automatically made over a secure channel.

    It's important to note that the effectiveness of these headers depends on proper implementation and server configuration. Different web frameworks and server setups may require specific methods for adding and configuring these headers. Careful consideration and testing are necessary to ensure compatibility and functionality across different browsers and platforms.

5. Explain NIST framework?

    ```text
    The NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) Cybersecurity Framework is a widely recognized and comprehensive set of guidelines, best practices, and standards that organizations can use to manage and improve their cybersecurity posture. It was developed by NIST in response to Executive Order 13636 issued by the U.S. President in 2013 to enhance critical infrastructure cybersecurity.

    The NIST Cybersecurity Framework consists of three main components:

    *   Core:
        The Core provides a set of cybersecurity activities and outcomes that organizations should consider when developing or improving their cybersecurity programs. It consists of five functions:

            a. Identify: Understand and document the assets, risks, and vulnerabilities within the organization.
            b. Protect: Implement safeguards to protect the organization's systems, data, and infrastructure.
            c. Detect: Develop and implement mechanisms to identify cybersecurity events and anomalies.
            d. Respond: Develop and execute response plans to mitigate the impact of cybersecurity incidents.
            e. Recover: Establish processes for restoring operations and recovering from cybersecurity incidents.

        Each function includes categories, subcategories, and informative references that organizations can tailor to their specific needs.

    *   Implementation Tiers:
        The Implementation Tiers help organizations understand and assess the maturity of their cybersecurity practices. There are four tiers: Partial, Risk Informed, Repeatable, and Adaptive. The tiers reflect increasing levels of sophistication and integration of cybersecurity practices within an organization.

    *   Profiles:
        Profiles allow organizations to align their cybersecurity objectives with their business requirements, risk tolerance, and available resources. A profile is a snapshot of the organization's current and desired cybersecurity posture, mapping the Core functions, categories, and subcategories to specific activities and outcomes.

    The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is flexible and can be applied to organizations of all sizes, sectors, and maturity levels. It serves as a common language for discussing and managing cybersecurity risks, promoting better communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

    Benefits of adopting the NIST Cybersecurity Framework include:

        *   Providing a structured approach to cybersecurity risk management.
        *   Facilitating alignment with industry standards, regulations, and best practices.
        *   Enhancing risk assessment, incident response, and recovery capabilities.
        *   Improving cybersecurity awareness and communication within the organization.
        *   Supporting collaboration and information sharing across sectors and organizations.

    Organizations can leverage the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to assess their current cybersecurity posture, identify gaps and areas for improvement, and establish a roadmap for enhancing their overall cybersecurity capabilities.
    ```

6. Pentest checklist based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework?

    ```text
    When creating a pentest (penetration testing) checklist based on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, you can include the following items for each of the framework's core functions:

    *   Identify:
            Conducting asset discovery to identify critical systems, applications, and data.

    In addition to these core function-related items, your pentest checklist can also include general security testing activities such as web application testing, network vulnerability scanning, social engineering assessments, and wireless network security evaluations.
    ```

7. Explain X-Frame-Options Header?

    ```text
    The X-Frame-Options header is used to protect against clickjacking attacks by controlling whether or not a web page can be displayed within an iframe. An iframe is an HTML element that allows another web page to be embedded within the current page.

    Clickjacking, also known as a UI redress attack, is a technique used by attackers to trick users into clicking on elements of a web page without their knowledge or consent. This can be achieved by overlaying an invisible or disguised iframe on top of a legitimate webpage, making the user unknowingly interact with the hidden content.

    The X-Frame-Options header helps prevent clickjacking by specifying the policy for rendering a web page inside an iframe. It can have the following three values:

    *   DENY:
        The DENY value indicates that the web page should not be displayed in any iframe, regardless of the origin of the containing page. This prevents the page from being embedded within any other website.

    *   SAMEORIGIN:
        The SAMEORIGIN value allows the web page to be displayed in an iframe only if the request originated from the same origin (i.e., the same domain). This restricts the embedding of the page to within the same website.

    *   ALLOW-FROM uri:
        The ALLOW-FROM value allows the web page to be displayed in an iframe if the request originated from the specified URI. This enables more granular control over which specific websites are allowed to embed the page.

    By setting the X-Frame-Options header with an appropriate value, web developers can protect their web pages from being embedded within iframes on malicious or unauthorized websites. This header is sent by the web server as part of the HTTP response, and the browser then honors the specified policy when rendering the web page.

    It's important to note that X-Frame-Options is being deprecated in favor of the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) header, which provides more robust and flexible options for controlling iframe embedding and offers additional security features. Therefore, it is recommended to use CSP instead of X-Frame-Options if possible.
    ```

8. What is SOP and how is it enforced ?

    ```text
    SOP (Same-Origin Policy) is enforced by web browsers to restrict interactions between web pages originating from different origins (combination of protocol, domain, and port). The enforcement of SOP helps mitigate security risks such as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and data leakage.

    Here are some key points on how SOP is enforced:

    *   Origin-Based Security Model:
        The core principle of SOP is based on the concept of the origin of a web page. Two web pages are considered to have the same origin if their protocols, domains, and ports match exactly.

    *   Access Restrictions:
        Under SOP, a web page from one origin is typically prevented from directly accessing or interacting with the resources (such as cookies, DOM elements, and XMLHttpRequest) of a different origin. This restriction helps prevent unauthorized access and protects user data.

    *   JavaScript Execution:
        SOP prohibits JavaScript code in one web page from accessing or manipulating the DOM (Document Object Model) of another web page from a different origin. This restriction prevents cross-site scripting attacks where malicious scripts can be injected into a vulnerable web page and steal sensitive information.

    *   Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):
        SOP allows limited cross-origin resource sharing through the use of CORS headers. Web servers can specify which origins are allowed to access specific resources through the use of appropriate HTTP headers. This enables controlled and secure sharing of resources across different origins.

    *   Origin Isolation:
        Browsers enforce SOP by isolating resources (e.g., cookies, local storage) on a per-origin basis. This means that resources associated with one origin are not accessible to web pages from other origins, providing a level of data privacy and security.

    *   Security Sandbox:
        Web browsers provide a security sandbox environment that isolates the execution of web pages and restricts access to sensitive resources. This sandboxing helps enforce SOP and prevents malicious code from compromising the integrity and security of the user's system or data.

    It's important to note that SOP is enforced by web browsers on the client-side, and developers must adhere to it when designing and implementing web applications. By enforcing SOP, browsers significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized data access and malicious attacks between different web origins.
    ```

9. What are cookies and its attributes?

    ```text
    A cookie is a small piece of data that is stored on a user's device by a website they visit. It is typically used to remember information about the user or their preferences for future interactions with the website. Cookies are widely used in web development and can serve various purposes, including session management, personalization, tracking, and authentication.

    A cookie has several attributes that define its behavior and characteristics. The most common attributes include:

    Name: The name or identifier of the cookie.
    Value: The value associated with the cookie.
    Domain: The domain or set of domains to which the cookie belongs. This attribute determines the websites that can access the cookie.
    Path: The path within the domain for which the cookie is valid. It specifies the URLs under which the cookie should be sent by the browser.
    Expiration/Max-Age: The expiration date or maximum age of the cookie. It determines how long the cookie will be stored on the user's device before it is automatically deleted. If not specified, the cookie is considered a session cookie and will be deleted when the user closes their browser.
    Secure: A boolean attribute indicating whether the cookie should only be sent over secure (HTTPS) connections.
    HttpOnly: A boolean attribute that, when set, prevents the cookie from being accessed by client-side scripting languages, such as JavaScript. This helps protect against certain types of cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.
    SameSite: An attribute that controls when the cookie is sent by the browser. It can be set to "Strict" (cookie is only sent for same-site requests), "Lax" (cookie is sent for same-site requests and some cross-site requests, such as top-level navigation), or "None" (cookie is sent for same-site and cross-site requests).
    SameParty: A relatively new attribute that allows cookies to be restricted to first-party use only. It ensures that cookies are not sent for cross-site requests, even if the SameSite attribute is set to "None".
    ```
